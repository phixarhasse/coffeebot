# Welcome to Coffeebot
Responsible for watching the office's coffee maker and sending notifications to a Slack channel.

## Hardware Requirements
[Shelly Plug or Plug S](https://www.shelly.cloud/products/shelly-plug-smart-home-automation-device/) for measuring coffeemaker power
and providing access to measurements through its embedded web server.

I recommend the Plug (without the 'S') as it's allows more current through it.

Optional: [Philips Hue Bridge](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/p/hue-bridge/8719514342583) and [Hue Colored Lights](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/products/smart-light-bulbs)

The Hue Bridge has an API through which coffeebot sets the color of all connected lights as follows:
- Red: coffeemaker turned off
- Slowly flashing yellow: coffee is brewing
- Green: coffee is done

## How to Install the Bot

The instructions assumes a working Python 3 enviroment. On `apt`-based operating systems try something like
`sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv`.

### _Note: The bot is currently calibrated for a Moccamaster KBG744 AO-B (double brewer)._

1. Download and unpack the project where you want it to run from.
2. Copy `.env-template` to `.env`  and adjust the following environment variables to the .env file:

```sh
USE_SLACK=      # True if you want to send coffee updates to Slack
SLACK_TOKEN=    # Secret OAuth authentication token for the app in Slack (you need to add an app called "CoffeeBot" to your Slack workspace to generate one)
CHANNEL_ID=     # ID of the channel to post messages in Slack
USE_HUE=        # True if you want your Hue lights to reflect coffee status
HUE_IP=         # The local IP address of the Hue Bridge
SENSOR_URL=     # The complete URL to the Shelly Plug, e.g. "http://192.168.0.10/meter/0" without the quotes (see Shelly docs for more details)
```

3. Copy `hue-template` to `hue_username` and change to your username in the file
4. If you chose to use Slack and/or Hue, the script will first setup these services. During Hue setup, you will be prompted to go press the button on the Hue Birdge to generate a token for the bot to use.
5. python3 -m venv env                 # Create python virtual enviroment 
5. source env/bin/activate             # Activate python virtual enviroment
6. pip install -r requirements.txt     # Install all dependencies
7. deactivate                          # Deactivate the enviroment

## How to Run the Bot

1. `source env/bin/activate` activates the python enviroment
2. `python coffee-bot.py` run Coffeebot
3. `deactivate` deactivates the enviroment
4. Now the bot should be running, time to make some coffee!

## Development

If you add any extra dependencies run (while inside the python enviroment)
`pip list --local --format=freeze > requirements.txt`
to update the requirements.
